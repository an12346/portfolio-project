    <h2><span class="about">About</span> Me:</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Hey I'm Anna!</strong> I graduated from the University of Washington Tacoma in June 2021 with a BA in psychology. However, I realized that maybe psychology was not the field I wanted to get into. But, I've always wanted to learn to code, so I decided to enroll at <em>Epicodus</em>! I worked as a nursing assistant previously, but I am hoping now to learn the skills I need to get a career in the tech industry.</p>
