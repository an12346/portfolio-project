    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>Hey I'm Anna! I graduated from the University of Washington Tacoma in June 2021 with a BA in psychology. However, I realized that maybe psychology was not the field I wanted to get into. But, I've always wanted to learn to code, so I decided to enroll at Epicicodus! I worked as a nursing assistant previously, but I am hoping now to learn the skills I need to get a career in the tech industry. My current hobbies include hiking, playing guitar, and yoga.</p>
